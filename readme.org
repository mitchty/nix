* My nix flake for system setup

This is all a work in progress so if you use anything from here, caveat emptor.

I am converting over all my home network to be as much in nixos+flakes as I can get. For now that is one system that is a bit of a test case. More will come at some point.

I'm not sure anything here is useful for anyone but me but the intended usage here is to run something like:

** New hotness

So the flake has deploy targets setup already, to update/rebuild all configured nodes run:

#+begin_src shell
clear; nix flake check --show-trace && nix run github:serokell/deploy-rs -- -s .
#+end_src

And should be good to go. Caveats on how/where deploy-rs can deploy to aside.

** Old and busted docs, should still work but meh

#+begin_src shell
./ci && ./rebuild
#+end_src

The 3 scripts function as:
 - bin/update.sh  - Updates the flake.lock file
 - bin/ci.sh      - Wrapper around {darwin,nixos}-rebuild build
 - bin/rebuild.sh - Wrapper around {darwin,nixos}-rebuild switch
