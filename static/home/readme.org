Jira cli homepage: https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli

For the jira cli I've created a function to act/mimic like an alias over the jira-cli to make interactions with jira less.... painful.

A note on *jira-cli* usage, if using pure api tokens one only need to set the folloing env var:

#+begin_src shell-script
export JIRA_API_TOKEN=whatever
#+end_src

But if using Personal Access Tokens one must also set auth type to bearer in *jira-cli* >= 1.0.0 like so:

#+begin_src shell-script
export JIRA_API_TOKEN=whatever
export JIRA_AUTH_TYPE=bearer
#+end_src

Ref: https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli/pull/269

Idea being the first arg is not an arg that jira cli has, so that I can make day to day interaction simpler.

Examples:

What not closed issues are assigned to me everywhere:
#+begin_src shell-script
j todo
#+end_src

Unassign an issue:

#+begin_src shell-script
j unassign EXAMPLE-1
#+end_src

Assign an issue to me:

#+begin_src shell-script
j self EXAMPLE-1
#+end_src

Assign an issue to myself and move it to in progress:

#+begin_src shell-script
j wip EXAMPLE-1
#+end_src

Move an issue to in progress:

#+begin_src shell-script
j inprogress EXAMPLE-1
#+end_src

Move an issue to in review:

#+begin_src shell-script
j inreview EXAMPLE-1
#+end_src

Move an issue to done:

#+begin_src shell-script
j done EXAMPLE-1
#+end_src

Add a comment to an issue:

#+begin_src shell-script
j comment EXAMPLE-1 comment text to add
# or
j comment EXAMPLE-1 "comment text to add\nwith\newlines"
#+end_src

Look at an issue in the command line

#+begin_src shell-script
j spy EXAMPLE-1
#+end_src

Further todos yet to be done:
- figuring out how to add/update labels
- how to add myself as a watcher
- query all issues i'm watching etc...
- more I'm sure... all I can think of at time of writing not comprehensive
